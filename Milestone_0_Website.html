            <p>Hello, My name is Jamal Grant. I am a student at Florida Atlantic University I am studying Computetr Engineering. I currently have experience with C, C++, HTML and CSS. By doing this course, I intend to gain confidence and improve my academic skills. I am really looking forward to the challenges that University life will bring me and I would welcome the opportunity to concentrate on the subject I am passionate about. I am also fully aware of its demands and challenges, but I am sure that my enthusiasm, maturity and strong determination will made me a successful student.I am currently working full time as a Selector at the Publix company. It is a job where teamwork, organisation and intense concentration are essential. Despite the fact that working and studying occupies most of my time, I love reading. I also enjoy travelling, visiting new places, meeting people and eating food.</p>
