                <p>Work up a sweat with this sample at-home workout from our program. Our Challenge is right around the corner and our anthem for this coming event is all about saying hello to a fresh start. With a year of ongoing change and pivots, our flagship challenge offering can be a great starting point for getting into a more consistent routine with your fitness and healthy-eating habits.
                    This challange comes with all sorts of bells and whistles for participants, but new this last round we introduced virtual, trainer-led Saturday Sweat Session workouts which quickly became an extremely popular part of our offering.

                        Whatever your fitness goals are, whatever your current level of fitness and experience is, and whatever equipment and space you have available, there’s a workout for you on this website.

                        However, it’s rare that we come across a single session that suits just about everyone. So when the team at activewear brand Sundried shared this lower-body session, we were all too happy to pass it on to you.

                        You’ll work through three sets of each exercise in the workout, hitting your legs and glutes particularly hard, but also working your core. It can be done just about anywhere, since all but one of the exercises are bodyweight moves, and the odd one out can be done with any DIY weight (we’ve taken to using a couple of bricks that were lying about the garden).

                        If you have some free weights hanging around, it’s easy to incorporate them to make the workout harder. Other ways of making the workout harder include slowing the movements down so your muscles spend more time under tension, and limiting the amount of rest you give yourself between sets.
