             <p>Most of us perform our most crucial and dynamic daily activities upright, on two feet, not lying supine on the floor. Moreover, classic floor exercises can be uncomfortable for many people, causing neck and lower-back pain.

                To build a core that supports an active lifestyle and avoid troubling floor exercises, there is a simple, six-move standing solution.

                “If someone said you could only do six core moves for the rest of your life, whether you’re 15 or 85, these are the ones you should choose,” he says.
            
                Be warned: These moves won’t look or feel like any ab workout you’ve ever done. But if you do them regularly, you’ll not only build a strong and functional core, you’ll also move more smoothly and comfortably, from your nose to your toes.</p>

            
        <h1>THE <span id="blue">WORKOUT</span></h1>

            <P>Each pair of core exercises below covers a single plane of movement: forward–back, side–side, and rotational right–left. As a whole, the six moves challenge your core in every possible direction.</P>

                    Assume an athletic stance (feet shoulder width apart, knees slightly bent); if you want, hold a light weight (a medicine ball or a pair of light dumbbells) in front of your chest.

                <li>
                    Take a long step forward with your right foot, simultaneously raising your arms overhead.
